std::cout << "Hey Soumyajit!" << "\n"; (faster prolly)
std::cout << "Hey Soumyajit!" << std::endl;

else if saves time.
indentations dont matter.
array print invalid index no error just garbage value.
7.7 in int array trimmed to 7.

referencing invalid string index no error thrown:
            It does, but only if you tell it to. Accessing an invalid index through [] is undefined behaviour. 
Which means the behaviour is not defined to give an error message, throw an exception, or crash the program. 
It could, but it doesn't have to, so implementations don't have to do the additional bounds check -- speeding things up. 
Accessing through at() is defined to throw an exception if the index is invalid.

s[0] = 'A' works but s[0] = "A" wont. (character not string)

array always passed with reference. vectors, map, lists - default passed by value.

return in c++?
